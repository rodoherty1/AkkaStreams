# AkkaStreams

## Examples
### Sources
* Source(1 to 10) print to screen
* Source from disk
* Source from website
* Source from a plain old function like List.unfold

### Flows
* A flow that uses my own ActorRef

### Sinks
* Sink that buffers elements into a collection
* Sink that writes to disk
* Sink that submits to a http request

### Threading
* Demonstrate that an Akka Stream is not called on the caller's thread
* Demomstrate that AkkaStreams will generally reuse a thread when executing successive processing stages
* Demomstrate that AkkaStreams will occasionally suspend a thread and use a different thread from the threadpool.

### Graphs
* Broadcast **_Todo_**
* Merge **_Todo_**

### Websocket Client with a Websocket Server
* Have the client call the server and make the server return a result **_Todo_**

## Topics that are not covered in this session
* Supervision strategies
* Streams insides Streams (e.g. an ActorRef that kicks off its own Stream)
* Distributed Streams
* Backpressure in depth

## Todo
* Show a simple Http Server which fulfills requeests
* Move some of examples from ```src/main/scala``` to ```src/test/scala```
* Document the basic terminology (graph stages, processing stage)
* Read this - http://blog.colinbreck.com/integrating-akka-streams-and-akka-actors-part-ii/
* Study this video and try to create a json parser - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x62K4ObBtw4&t=1692s
* Look for examples in our code of where we use Streams, explain why we chose Streams and explain how Streams might help us in the future.
* Remember that not everyone is a Scala coder - Keep examples syntactically simple.
* Explain how Akka Streams is memory bounded
* Read http://akka.io/blog/2016/07/30/mastering-graph-stage-part-1
